The following elements must be added to shell's PATH environment:

		path_to_iWAVEv9520/rvl/seq/main
		path_to_iWAVEv9520/iwave/acd/main
		path_to_iWAVEv9520/iwave/asg/main
		path_to_iWAVEv9520/iwave/base/main
		path_to_iWAVEv9520/iwave/helm/main
		path_to_iWAVEv9520/iwave/trace/main
		path_to_iWAVEv9520/iwave++/acd++/main
