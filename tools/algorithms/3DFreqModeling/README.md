# 3D Frequency-Domain Modeling Kernel
##  DESCRIPTION
 This package contains the Matlab functions to manipulate the discrete 3D 
 acoustic wave equation operator in frequency domain as well as various quantities 
 depending on solutions to the acoustic wave equation (least squares objective/gradient,
 demigration/migration operators, etc.). This package uses components from tools/algorithms/CommonFreqModeling, as well as 

helm3d_operto27_mvp.m
: Provides an interface to the 27pt stencil Helmholtz matrix vector product (with adjoint + derivative opertions), calls MEX functions

helm3d_operto27_kaczswp.m
: Provides an interface to the 27pt stencil Helmholtz kaczmarz sweep, calls MEX functions

helm3d_7pt_mvp.m
: Provides an interface to the 27pt stencil Helmholtz matrix vector product (with adjoint + derivative opertions)

-- Wrappers to PDEfunc_dist.m / PDEfunc.m
F3d.m
: This function generates 3D acoustic frequency domain data, as well as an associated Jacobian operator. 

opDF3d.m | oppDF3d.m
: SPOT operator for the demigration/migration operator (Jacobian)

opH3D.m | oppH3d.m
: SPOT operator for the full Hessian of FWI

-- Depreciated, explicit matrix code
helmholtz_3d_7p.m - standard 7p matrix stencil

helmholtz_3d.m - 27pt compact stencil of Operto '07

Hmvp.m | Hmvp_MT_mex - C-based code for explicit compressed band-storage matrix vector multiplication
