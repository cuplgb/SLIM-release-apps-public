#Seismic data regularization, interpolation and denoising using SVD-free low-rank matrix factorization.

##DESCRIPTION
This package contains Matlab functions for seismic data interpolation and denoising.
    runinterp         - read all the user sepcified input data and parameters
    timetofreq        - Convert input time domain data into frequency domain to
                        perform interpolation and/ or denoising on monochromatic
                        frequency slices. We only select the positive part of spectra.
    freqtotime        - Convert interpolated and/or denoised output data into time domain.
    syndata           - Make data set for test case attached with the package.
    opMH              - Perform source-receiver to midpoint-offset transformation on each
                        monochromatic frequency slices.
    LowRank_2D        - Distribute the input data and call main function one each
                        monochromatic frequency slices to perform interpolation
                        and/ or denoising.
    Interp_Denoise    - Main function to perform the interpolation and /or denoising
                        on each monochromatic frequency slices.
    Reg_Interp        - Main function to perform the regularization, interpolation and /or denoising
                        on each monochromatic frequency slices.
