# Krylov Solvers for 3D Acoustic Wave Equation
##  DESCRIPTION
 This contains all the functions needed to run our basic Krylov solvers, such
 as CRMN, CGMN and their respective CARP versions. These are meant to be used
 in combination with the discrete operator generated by the 3DFreqModeling
 package, and should not work for standard Matlab sparse matrices.
 
CGMN.m
: Solves a linear system using CGMN. Supports multiple right hand sides.
  
CRMN.m
: Solves a linear system using CRMN. Supports multiple right hand sides.

FGMRES
: Solves a linear system using (flexible) GMRES solver. It is meant to be used
  in combination with a preconditioner, such as the multigrid shifted Laplacian
  preconditioner. For more information, read the documentation of the Multigrid
  package.

Other routines present in this package but that should not be called 
individually are
    dsweep      - performs a double Kaczmarz sweep. Used internally by CGMN
                  and CRMN.
    pdsweep     - performs a CARP iteration (or "parallel sweep"). This is 
                  called by CARPCG and CARPCR.                  
  
  
For the sake of compatibility, the legacy version of some of these routines is
still maintained, but will be removed in the future (to be announced). The
list of functions in the legacy version is:
 
    CARPCG_OLD  - Old routine for CGMN (original name was CARPCG). Deprecated 
                  due to the misleading name. Function call has been as well 
                  updated.
    CARPBCG     - Block CGMN. Deprecated due to the misleading name.
    pCARPCG     - Parallel CARPCG; CARPCG.m function replaces this with an 
                  updated function call
    test_pCARPCG - Validates the pCARPCG routine. It haven't been udpated to 
                  validate the new CARPCG routine as of now.
  
   CARPCG
   : The parallel version of CGMN, as proposed in [3].
   NOTE: This function **requires** the system matrix to have normalized rows. 
   The right hand side must be properly scaled as well. See demos for more 
   details.
  
   CARPCR
   : The parallel version of CRMN, as proposed in [2].
   NOTE: This function **requires** the system matrix to have normalized rows. 
   The right hand side must be properly scaled as well. See demos for more 
   details.
