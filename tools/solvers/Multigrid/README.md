# Krylov Solvers for 3D Acoustic Wave Equation
##  DESCRIPTION
 This package adds the possibility of using FGMRES solver preconditioned by
 geometric multigrid solvers. The package is generic enough to allow the user 
 to build certain advanced multigrid cycles (as a combination of V cycles)
 but it provides wrappers to already built efficient multigrid schemes tailored
 specifically for the acoustic wave equation.
 
GMG_V
: Performs the most basic multigrid V cycle. The smoother and coarse correctors
  are passed as a parameter in a structure **par**. Building up the coarse 
  operator and the interpolators might be nontrivial, so we refer to 
  GMG_CGPV12_T2V and  GMG_CGPV12_N2V routines, which set up the **par** 
  structure for more information.
  
GMG_CGPV12_T2V
: Returns a function handler to a GMG_V solver with the **par** structure 
  properly set up. The choice of smoothers, interpolators and coarse correctors
  are due to [1]. This is meant to be used as a preconditioner for FGMRES. 
  This uses the shifted Laplacian operator.
  NOTE: This is meant to be used by standard 7-points finite difference
  discretization, generated by the helmholtz_3d_7p. This is **not** meant to be
  used by the 27 points schemes. Refer to GMG_CGPV12_T2V for the 27 points 
  version.

GMG_CGPV12_N2V
: Returns a function handler to a GMG_V solver with the **par** structure 
  properly set up. The choice of smoothers, interpolators and coarse correctors
  are due to [2]. This is meant to be used as a preconditioner for FGMRES. 
  This uses the shifted Laplacian operator.
  NOTE: This is meant to be used by standard 27 points discretization, generated
  by the helmholtz_3d. 
  
GMG_CGPV12_T
: A simpler version of GMG_CGPV12_T2V, using a simple V cycle without the 
  shifted Laplacian operator. Also introduced in [1], and meant to be used
  as a preconditioner for FGMRES.
  NOTE: This is meant to be used by standard 7-points finite difference
  discretization, generated by the helmholtz_3d_7p. This is **not** meant to be
  used by the 27 points schemes. 
  
Another function present in this package is the Jacobi_relax, used as a smoother
in some of the aforementioned preconditioners.
