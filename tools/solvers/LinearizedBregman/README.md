Linearized Bregman Method
##  DESCRIPTION
 This package contains the linearized Bregman method, an iterative solver for L1/L2 constrained problems. 
 The linearized Bregman method solves a version of the basis pursuit (or basis pursuit denoise) problem 
 with a strongly convex objective function
	
	minimize   lambda*||x||_1 + 0.5*||x||_2^2
	subject to A*x = b (or ||A*x-b||_2 < sigma)

For certain lambdas, that are higher than 'some' threshold value, solving the former problem also
solves the basis pursuit (bp denoise) problem.

##  PREREQUISITES
 All prerequisites, except for MATLAB, are provided in the software
 release repositories and should be installed as necessary before using
 any of SINBAD's software.
##  INSTALLATION
###  Software in SLIM-release-apps (this) repository
 Follow the instructions in the INSTALLATION file (located in the home
 directory of this software repository) to install necessary
 comp[onents.
##  DOCUMENTATION
 Documenation to can be accessed by typing 'help lbm' in the matlab terminal.
##  RUNNING
 For solving the basis pursuit (denoise) problem with a strongly convex objective function call

	[x, residual, info] = lbm(A,b,lambda,sigma,x0,options)

The necessary input parameters, as well as the output variables are explained in the function documentation.
###  Preparing shell environment
 You must setup your shell environment according to the steps listed in
 the README located in home directory of the software release.
###  Running applications/demos
 'sparseRecovery.m' shows how to use the function lbm.m to recover a sparse vector from noisy measurements.
 'traceInterpol.m' demonstrates how to use the linearzed Bregman method for seismic trace interpolation.
 using curvelets. Both scripts can be run from the matlab terminal.
