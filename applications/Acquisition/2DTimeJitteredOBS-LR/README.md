# Rank minimization based source-separation in time-jittered 2D ocean-bottom marine acquisition.


## DESCRIPTION
This package is an application of a 2D time-jittered (or blended) marine 
     acquisition scheme, and a deblending algorithm based on rank-minimization.
The acquisition setup for generating the blended data is same as proposed by Haneet Wason.
However, we offer an efficient deblending algorithm using rank-minimization based techniques.

## PREREQUISITES
All prerequisites, except for MATLAB, are provided with the
     software release and should be installed before using any of
     SINBAD's software.


## INSTALLATION
Follow the instructions in the INSTALLATION file (located in the
     root directory of this software release) to install all 3-rd party
     software (except for MATLAB) and SINBAD's software.


## DOCUMENTATION
Documentation and examples in .html format are included in the ./doc directory.


## RUNNING
Start matlab from this directory or run startup.m file from this directory 
to set the correct paths. The scripts that produced the example can be found in ./examples. 

1. To run the example, first download the data from<br />
    	 <ftp://ftp.slim.gatech.edu/data/SoftwareRelease/Common/GulfOfSuez><br />
        by typing `scons' in the ./data directory

2. Specific instructions for the example can be found in the file README.md in the 
        ./examples directory.

3. Pre-run results can be downloaded from<br />
        <ftp://ftp.slim.gatech.edu/data/SoftwareRelease/Acquisition/2DTimeJitteredOBS-LR/results><br />
        by typing `scons' in the ./results directory

4. To run the algorithm on your own data, see the file README.md in the 
        ./examples directory.


## SUPPORT
You may contact developers of SINBAD software by means of:

1. GitHub issue tracker<br />
       Submit issue at [SLIM-release-apps issues](https://github.com/SINBADconsortium/SLIM-release-apps/issues).

2. Direct mail<br />
