%% Source separation via SVD-free rank minimization in the hierarchical semi-separable representation
%
% This application is available only in the software release for members of SINBAD consortium.
%
% This software release includes a demonstration of a 2-D over/under blended marine acquisition scenario, and a source separation algorithm based on a SVD-free rank minimization scheme.
%
% Author: Haneet Wason (hwason@eos.ubc.ca)
%
% Date: June, 2014; July, 2016 - parallel version of the code made available.

%% Downloading & Dependencies
%
% The code can be found in the <https://www.slim.eos.ubc.ca/consortiumsoftware SLIM software release> under |/applications/Acquisition/SourceSeparationLowRankHSS|.
%
% The code has been tested with _Matlab R2015b_. The updated code requires the Parallel Computing Toolbox.
%
% This code uses the following packages, also found in the |tools| part of the <https://www.slim.eos.ubc.ca/consortiumsoftware SLIM software release>.
%
% * _utilities/SPOT-SLIM_ - object oriented framework for matrix-free linear algebra.
% * _utilities/SegyMAT_ - Matlab/Octave toolbox for reading and writing SEG-Y formatted files.
% * _solvers/GenSPGL1_ - Generalized SPGL1.


%% Running & Parallelism
%
% All the examples and results are produced by the scripts found in this software release under |applications/Acquisition/SourceSeparationLowRankHSS/examples/|. Start matlab from |applications/Acquisition/SourceSeparationLowRankHSS| to add the appropriate paths. 
% 
% To run the scripts follow the instructions in the README file enclosed with the code. The scripts are run in parallel mode.
