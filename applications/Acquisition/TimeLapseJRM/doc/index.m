%% Joint recovery method for time-lapse seismic data
%
% This application is available only in the software release for members of SINBAD consortium.
% 
% This package is an application for time-lapse data acquired with randomized sampling schemes, and a joint recovery method based on sparse inversion (via L1 minimization). In particular, we show the performance of the method for: (i) data with random missing shots, and (ii) data simulated for a time-jittered, blended marine acquisition.

%% Downloading & Dependencies
%
% The code can be found in the <https://www.slim.eos.ubc.ca/consortiumsoftware SLIM sofware release> under
% |/applications/Acquisition/TimeLapseJRM|.
%
% The code has been tested with _Matlab R2013a_.
%
% This code uses the following packages, also found in the |tools| part of the <https://www.slim.eos.ubc.ca/consortiumsoftware SLIM software release>.
%
% * _utilities/SPOT_ - object oriented framework for matrix-free linear algebra.
% * _utilities/SegyMAT_ - Matlab/Octave toolbox for reading and writing SEG-Y formatted files.
% * _functions/misc_ - miscellaneous functions.
% * _solvers/SPGL1-SLIM_ - SLIM version of SPGL1 solver.
% * _transforms/CurveLab-2.1.2-SLIM_ - curvelet transform functions.


%% Running & Parallelism
%
% All the examples and results are produced by the scripts found in this software release under |applications/Acquisition/TimeLapseJRM/|. Start matlab from that directory or run |startup| in that directory to add the appropriate paths.
%
% To run the scripts follow the instructions in the README file enclosed with the code. The scripts can be run in serial mode.
