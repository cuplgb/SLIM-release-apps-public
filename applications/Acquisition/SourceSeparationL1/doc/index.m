%% Source separation for towed-streamer marine data via sparsity promotion
%
% This application is available only in the software release for members of SINBAD consortium.
% 
% This package contains a MATLAB implementation of a 2-D over/under blended marine acquisition scheme, and a deblending (or source separation) algorithm based on sparsity-promoting inversion in the curvelet domain using L1 minimization.

%% Downloading & Dependencies
%
% The code can be found in the <https://www.slim.eos.ubc.ca/consortiumsoftware SLIM sofware release> under |applications/Acquisition/SourceSeparationL1|.
%
% The code has been tested with _Matlab R2015b_.
%
% This code uses the following packages, also found in the |tools| part of the <https://www.slim.eos.ubc.ca/consortiumsoftware SLIM software release>.
%
% * _utilities/SPOT_ - object oriented framework for matrix-free linear algebra.
% * _utilities/SegyMAT_ - Matlab/Octave toolbox for reading and writing SEG-Y formatted files.
% * _functions/misc_ - miscellaneous functions.
% * _solvers/SPGL1-SLIM_ - SLIM version of SPGL1 solver.
%
% The CurveLab package is downloaded from the |tools| part of the SLIM-release-comp repository. 
% * _transforms/CurveLab-2.1.2-SLIM_ - curvelet transform functions.


%% Functions
%
% Some functions specific to this package can be found in the |applications/Acquisition/SourceSeparationL1/misc_funcs| directory.


%% Running & Parallelism
%
% All the examples and results are produced by the scripts found in this software release under |applications/Acquisition/SourceSeparationL1|. Start matlab from that directory or run |startup| in that directory to add the appropriate paths.
%
% To run the scripts follow the instructions in the README file under |applications/Acquisition/SourceSeparationL1/examples|. The scripts are run in serial mode but can also be run in parallel with slight modifications to the code. Please see the README file.
