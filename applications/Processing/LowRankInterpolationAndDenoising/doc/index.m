%% Seismic data regularization, missing-trace interpolation and denoising using SVD-free low-rank matrix factorization.
%
%
% This applications is available only in the software release for members of SINBAD consortium.
%
%
% This software provides an algorithm for seismic data regularization,
% missing-trace interpolation and denoising (using Generalized SPGl1 as solver). The algorithm
% solves the system in parallel over frequencies. 
% The regularization, missing-trace interpolation and denoising is done using 
% robust-rank regularized formulation. We illustrate the advantages of 
% the new approach using a seismic line from Gulf of Suez.

%% Downloading & Dependencies
% The synthetic examples code can be found in the <https://www.slim.eos.ubc.ca/consortiumsoftware SLIM software release> under
% |applications/Processing/LowRankInterpolationAndDenoising|.
%
% The code has been tested with _Matlab R2013a_ and require the Parallel
% Computing Toolbox.
%
% This code uses the following packages, also found in the |tools| part
% of the <https://www.slim.eos.ubc.ca/consortiumsoftware SLIM software release>.
%
% * _utilities/SPOT-SLIM_ - object oriented framework for matrix-free linear algebra.
% * _tools/algorithms/LowRankMinimization_ - Matrix factorization based
%                                            low-rank optimization algorithm.
% * _tools/solvers/GenSPGL1_ - Generalized SPGL1.

%% Running & Parallelism
% All the examples and results are produced by the scripts found in
% this software release under |/applications/Processing/LowRankInterpolationAndDenoising/examples/|. 
% Start matlab from |/applications/Processing/LowRankInterpolationAndDenoising| to add the appropriate paths.
%
% 
% To run the scripts follow the instrictions in the README file enclosed
% with the code.
%% Functions
% The regularization, missing-trace interpolation and denoising code can be found in 
% |_tools/algorithms/LowRankMinimization_|. The main components are listed below 
%
% _algorithms/LowRankMinimization_
%
% * |runinterp|  - Read the input parameter and data 
% * |opMH|       - Transform monochromatic frequency slice from
%                  the source-receiver domain to the midpoint-offset domain.
% * |LowRank_2D| - Perform regularization, missing-trace interpolation and denoising in
%                  the midpoint-offset domain.
