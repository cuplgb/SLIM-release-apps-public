%% Fast least-squares imaging with source estimation using multiples
% This applications is available only in the software release for
% members of SINBAD consortium.
%
% This software provides an algorithm to do fast least-squares
% migration while estimating the source wavelet on the fly by variable
% projection. Using multiples further improves image quality and
% enables the retrieval of the true-amplitude image and source
% wavelet. The inversion process is sped up by using source/frequency
% subsampling and rerandomization.

%% Downloading & Dependencies
% The code can be found in the <https://www.slim.eos.ubc.ca/consortiumsoftware SLIM software release> under
% |/applications/Imaging/L1MIGRATIONwVP|.
%
% The code has been tested with _Matlab R2013b_ and requires the Parallel
% Computing Toolbox.
%
% This code uses the following packages, also found in the |tools| part
% of the <https://www.slim.eos.ubc.ca/consortiumsoftware SLIM software release>.
%
% * _utilities/SPOT_ - object oriented framework for matrix-free linear algebra.
% * _utilities/pSPOT_ - parallel extension of SPOT.
% * _algorithms/2DFreqModeling_ - 2D constant-density acoustic modeling
% * _tools/algorithms/REPSI_ - Robust EPSI algorithm
% * _operators/misc_ - Misc. operators such as interpolation, smoothing and splines
% * _functions/misc_ - Misc. functions.
% * _tools/solvers/GenSPGL1_ - Generalized SPGL1

%% Running & Parallelism
% All the examples and results are produced by the scripts found in
% this software release under |/applications/Imaging/L1MIGRATIONwVP/examples/|. 
% Start matlab from |/applications/Imaging/L1MIGRATIONwVP| to add the appropriate paths.
%
% To run the scripts follow the instructions in the README file
% enclosed inside the folder for each set of examples.
% 
% The scripts can be run in serial mode while parallel mode is advised.
