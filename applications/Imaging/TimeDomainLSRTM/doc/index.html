         <introduction>
            <p>This applications is available only in the software release for members of SINBAD consortium.</p>
            <p>This software provides an algorithm to perform least-squares RTM with sparsity promotion using the linearized Bregman method.
               By subsampling the sources in each iteration, the overall number of PDE solves lies in the range of a regular RTM image, making
               this method feasible for large-scale problems.

% prediction, please contact the author.

%% Running & Parallelism
% All the examples and results are produced by the scripts found in
% this software release under |/applications/Imaging/TimeDomainLSRTM/examples/|. 
% Start matlab from |/applications/Imaging/TimeDomainLSRTM| to add the appropriate paths.
%
% To run the scripts follow the instructions in the README file
% enclosed inside the folder for each set of examples.
% 
% The scripts can be run in serial mode but parallel mode is advised.
