         <introduction>
            <p>This applications is available only in the software release for members of SINBAD consortium.</p>
            <p>This software provides an algorithm to image from the entire upgoing wavefield by sparse inversion. The inversion process
               is sped up by using source/frequency subsampling and renewal.
