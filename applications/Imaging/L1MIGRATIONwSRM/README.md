# Fast imaging with surface-related multiples by sparse inversion.
## DESCRIPTION
This package includes 1) the algorithm 2) synthetic examples. The
    algorithm is in directory "migfcts" and the examples are in "examples",
    both under current folder.
## COPYRIGHT
You may use this code only under the conditions and terms of the
    license contained in the file LICENSE or COPYING.txt provided with

    root directory of this software release) to install all 3-rd party
    software (except for MATLAB) and SINBAD's software.
## DOCUMENTATION
Documentation are included in directory "./doc" under current folder. 
    Help can also be accessed from Matlab via the 'help' command for 
    each function.
## RUNNING
1. existing scripts<br />
    1.1 Matlab must be started in THIS directory for you to correctly set
    up the environment.<br />
    1.2 You can find two sets of examples under "./examples/saltdome": one
    named "saltdome" and another one named "sigsbee". Go into either folder, 
    there are scripts corresponding to different experiments. Read 
    "README.md" in each folder to learn more.
2. running your own data<br />
	2.1 To run your own data set, source estimation is required, which has been included in another application in the SLIM software release - L1MIGRATIONwVP.
