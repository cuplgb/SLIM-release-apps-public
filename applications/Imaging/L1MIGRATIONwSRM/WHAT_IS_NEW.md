## What is new:

1. Scripts to produce the main results shown in paper "N. Tu and F. J. Herrmann, Fast imaging with surface-related multiples by sparse inversion, Geophysical Journal international, 2015, 201, 304-317" are now added.

2. New examples include: (1) a more realistic case study: in this case study, I generate data using iWave with a free-surface boundary condition, and invert data using SLIM's in-house frequency-domain modelling engine. (2) a case-study with a kinematically wrong background model.
