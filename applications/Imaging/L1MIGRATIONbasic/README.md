# 2D Efficient least-squares imaging with sparsity promotion and compressive sensing.

##DESCRIPTION
The computational cost for solving least-squares imaging problem is prohibitive. 
	It mainly depends on the number of partial-differential equation solves required 
	while inversion. In this work, we borrow ideas from compressive sensing and 
	stochastic optimization to turn the original over-determined least-squares 
	imaging problem into a under-determined problem. With this approach, it can 
	allow us to compute least-squared imaging with a subsampled data, yielding a 
	significant speed-up.

This package is an application for the Efficient least-squares imaging. In 
	which we include a toy model example as well as examples with BG compass model 
	(synthetic model created with constraint from real well-log information).
    An overview of the results can be found in the ./Doc directory.

use this software.
## PREREQUISITES
All prerequisites, except for MATLAB, are provided with the
software release and should be installed before using any of
SINBAD's software.
## INSTALLATION
Follow the instructions in the INSTALLATION file (located in the
root directory of this software release) to install all 3-rd party
software (except for MATLAB) and SINBAD's software.
	
Before using this package you should make sure your environment is
setup correctly. First run 'matlab\_path.m' which in the home directory
of this package in Matlab to append all the included software 
modules to the search path.
## DOCUMENTATION
Documentation and examples in .html format are included in the ./Doc subdirectory.<br />
Help can also be accessed from Matlab via the `help' command.
## RUNNING
This package contains the examples in [1] which can be found in './Examples/'. <br />

1. To run the examples, first go to './Data/' folder, and run<br />
		'scons' to fetch the data from SLIM ftp
2. Then go to './Examples/' folder, run 'LSM_toy_model_L1_WR.m' using 3 workers in
                parallel pool to test the algorithm;
                or run 'LSM_BGcompass_model2d_L1_WR.m' using 10 workers in parallel pool
                for the result based on BG model.
3. To view the results, please go to './Results/' folder. Then
		you can find saved results here. Since this package using an
		iterative method, you can view the results iteratively, and also
		you can run 'scons' under './Results/' folder to get pre-run results.
		
## NOTES
A part of the Compass Model, developed by the BG group is distributed
with this release.<br />
Please refer to BG_DISCLAIMER.txt in the ./Data directory before
downloading the data.
