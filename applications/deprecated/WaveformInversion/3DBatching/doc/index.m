%% Downloading & Dependencies
% The code can be found in the <https://www.slim.eos.ubc.ca/consortiumsoftware SLIM sofware release> under
% |/applications/WaveformInversion/3DBatching|.
%
% The code has been tested with _Matlab R2012b_ and requires the Parallel
% Computing Toolbox for some of the functionality.
%
% This code uses the following packages, also found in the |tools| part
% of the <https://www.slim.eos.ubc.ca/consortiumsoftware SLIM software release>.
%
% * _utilities/SPOT_ - object oriented framework for matrix-free linear algebra.
% * _utilities/pSPOT_ - parallel extension of SPOT.
% * _algorithms/3DFreqModeling_ - 3D variable-density acoustic modeling
% * _operators/misc_ - Misc. operators such as interpolation, smoothing and splines
% * _functions/misc_ - Misc. functions.

%% Running & Parallelism
% All the examples and results are produced by the scripts found in
% this software release under |applications/WaveformInversion/3DBatching/|. 
% Start matlab from that directory or run |startup| in that directory to add the appropriate paths.
%
% To run the scripts follow the instrictions in the README file enclosed
% with the code.
% Most scripts can be run in serial mode.
% 
% Read more about <https://www.slim.eos.ubc.ca/SoftwareDemos/tools/ SLIM's approach to parallel computing in Matlab>.
