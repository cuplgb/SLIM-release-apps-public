#3D full-waveform inversion
This applications is available only in the software release for members of SINBAD consortium.

#DESCRIPTION
This package contains a matlab scripts that illustrate the 3D waveform
    inversion algorithm as described in the Technical Report 
    "3D Frequency-domain seismic inversion using a row-projected Helmholtz solver",
    T. van Leeuwen and F.J. Herrmann, 2013.<br />
    An overview of the results can be found in the ./doc directory and online:<br />
    <https://www.slim.eos.ubc.ca/SoftwareDemos/applications/WaveformInversion/3DBatching/>

    license contained in the file LICENSE or COPYING.txt provided with
    this source code. If you do not agree to these terms you may not
    use this software.
#PREREQUISITES
All prerequisites, except for MATLAB, are provided with the
    software release and should be installed before using any of
    SINBAD's software.
#INSTALLATION
Follow the instructions in the INSTALLATION file (located in the
    root directory of this software release) to install all 3-rd party
    software (except for MATLAB) and SINBAD's software.
#DOCUMENTATION
Documentation and examples in .html format are included in the ./doc
subdirectory.  Help can also be accessed from Matlab via the `help' command.

#RUNNING
Start matlab from this directory or run startup.m to set the correct paths.

1. To run the scripts, first download the data and models from<br />
        <ftp://ftp.slim.gatech.edu/data/SoftwareRelease/WaveformInversion/3DBatching/data/>
       by typing `scons' in the ./data directory
2. The scripts that produced the examples shown in the documentation can be found in ./scripts.

#NOTES

## Controlling the number of threads

Some linear solvers in this application (such as `(p)CARP(B)CG.m`) make use of
a MEX file: `sweepR_mex`. This MEX file implements the Kaczmarz (serial) or
CARP (parallel) algorithms. Parallelism is implemented via threads
(specifically, the `pthreads` library). By default, the number of threads is
set to one. It can be controlled in two ways: either via the `OMP_NUM_THREADS`
environment variable or via an optional extra argument to `sweepR_mex`. To
specify the number of threads via an environment variable, execute the
following at the MATLAB prompt, replacing `'10'` with the desired number of
threads:

```
setenv('OMP_NUM_THREADS', '10');
```

To use instead the extra optional argument to `sweepR_mex`, call it as follows:

```
sweepR_mex(R,idx,x,b,w,d,10);
```

Where the first 6 arguments are the mandatory ones, explained in the header
comment of the source code file `sweepR_mex.c`, and the last argument is the
number of threads to use. 

NOTE: the optional argument, if provided, takes precedence over the environment
variable.  

If there are multiple MATLAB workers on one node, be careful to not set the
OMP_NUM_THREADS too high, since each worker doing parallel CARP sweeps will use
that many threads. For example, setting OMP_NUM_THREADS to 32 while there are 4
MATLAB workers per node means there will be 32 x 4 = 128 parallel CARP threads,
which may be too high. Experiment to find the best combination of MATLAB MPI
parallelism and parallel CARP sweeps via multi-threading on your machine.
