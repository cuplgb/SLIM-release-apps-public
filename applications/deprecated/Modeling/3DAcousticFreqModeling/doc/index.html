         <h2>Description<a name="1"></a></h2>
         <p>This package contains the Matlab functions to manipulate the discrete 3D acoustic wave equation operator in frequency domain.
            It is primarily based on a staggered grid dispersion minimizer second order finite differences stencil first proposed in [1],
            using PML. In addition, we currently have implemented the standard second order 7 points finite differences stencil with PML
            (c.f. [2] for more details).
         </p>
         <h2>Running &amp; Parallelism<a name="2"></a></h2>
         <p>All the examples can be reproduced by running the scripts found in the software release under <tt>applications/Modeling/3DAcousticFreqModeling</tt>. Start matlab from that directory or run <tt>startup</tt> in that directory to add the appropriate paths.
         </p>
         <p>To properly run some of the demos and tests, it is necessary to download data files from the SLIM FTP server.</p>
         <p><b>Installation with SCONS</b></p>
         <p>Enter the data directory and use the scons executable:</p>
         <p><tt>cd ./data</tt></p>
         <p><tt>scons</tt></p>
         <p><b>Installation without SCONS</b></p>
         <p>Download all the data files found in</p>
         <p><tt>ftp://slim.eos.ubc.ca/data/SoftwareRelease/Modeling/3DAcousticFreqModeling/data</tt></p>
         <p>and place them into ./data folder. The files are <tt>m_init.rsf</tt>, <tt>m_true.rsf</tt> and <tt>Dobs.rsf</tt>.
         </p>
         <p><b>Remark:</b> Currently, most of this code is for sequential use only. Most notabily, it does not discretize the Helmholtz operator in
            parallel, but in sequential mode. It is possible to distribute the discrete operator to then be used by parallel solvers such
            as CARPCR.
         </p>
         <p>In future releases, this issue will be tackled.</p>

         <p><tt>help function_name</tt></p>
         <p>for more details on the input and output of each function. Unless otherwise specified, all function in this package are in
            its stable release, meaning that its efficiency in computational time, accuracy and memory use has been confirmed through
            several numerical experiments. Those marked as (beta) and (alpha) should function properly, but have not been extensively
            tested yet and are thus subject to improvements in the future.

         </div>
         <p>The main function of this package. Given a velocity model and an acquisition geometry with its respective dataset, this returns
            the predicted data, the value of the misfit function for that dataset and the gradient. Each output parameter is optional
            and can be disabled.
         </p>
         <p>This function handles the whole discretization process; it shrinks/stretches the domain to satisfy stability conditions depending
            on the frequency. It also adds the PML of the proper size and gives an option to cut the PML out or to stack PML points (its
            adjoint). The full description of all the options for this function can be found in its own documentation. Use <tt>help WaveEquationFD</tt> for more details.

         <p>A wrapper to WaveEquationFD which returns only the computed data. This function (that is, the data output) has been tested
            much more extensively than WaveEquationFD and thus is considered almost in its stable release. Consult the demo for a comparison

         </div>
         <p>Computes the discrete Helmholtz operator using a staggered grid second order finite differences scheme. The output is an array
            with  dimension (27,nx*ny*nz), or in other words, it stores the discrete operator in a band- storage format rather than as
            a sparse matrix. Each column of this array represents a point in the physical domain. This stencil is discussed in [1] and
            it aims at minimizing the disperson error, attaining stability with as little as 4 points per wavelength in homogeneous testcases.
            We usually recommend the use of 6 points per wavelength for heterogeneous media.
         </p>
         <p>Example: <a href="demo_helmholtz_3d.html">examples/demo_helmholtz_3d.m</a>. See also <a href="demo_R_Helm3D.html">examples/R_Helm3D.m</a> for an example using the legacy code.

         <p>Given a structure model (containing the velocity model and grid spacing) and the frequency, this function returns a structure
            containing all the parameters needed to compute the discrete operator with a stable computational grid spacing. It automatically
            sets the PML size, interpolates the given model to the required size, and returns function handlers that allow the user to
            easily manage data both on the model grid and on the computational grid. It also returns the discrete operator (by default,
            but can be disabled to merely compute the proper stable parameters).
         </p>
         <p>To understand better the output of this function, it is important to distinguish the computational grid from the physical
            grid.
         </p>
         <p>The physical grid is the grid in which the velocity model is provided. For computing a numerical solution for the wave equation,
            however, we might need a finer (or coarser) grid. This is associated with the wavelength of the waves being propagated in
            the frequency domain, and thus depends on the target frequency. Also, the computational grid may contain an artificial absorbing
            layer to avoid reflections.

            is required, for instance, to compute the gradient of the misfit function efficiently in the adjoint- state formulation, instead
            of computing the full Jacobian. Although this is a tensor, it can be stored exactly as H itself, in band-storage format. Using
            this object might be a bit trickier than expected. Please, refer to the full documentation, the demos or Matlab's Help on

         <p>Multiplies a vector by a matrix in band-storage format (such as the operator generated with helmholtz_3d and helmholtz_3d_7p).
            It calls a mex  function to perform the matrix-vector product itself in an efficient and multi-threaded environment.

            </ul>
         </div>
         <p>Very similar to helmholtz_3d.m, except that this generates a discrete operator using the standard second order 7 points stencil
            with the PML; Please refer to [2] Appendix A for more details on this stencil. This generates a  matrix with 7 diagonals only
            (as opposed to 27) but requires more points per wavelength. In the literature it is common the use of 10 points per wavelength,
            but 12 points is a more conservative and also a popular choice.

            </ul>
         </div>
         <p>Replaces the old setup_solver and partially replaces discrete_helmholtz function. It follows the same syntax as discrete_helmholtz
            but returns the discrete operator as wel as a pointer for the linear solver. The solver is chosen based on the size of the
            problem, discretization used, amongst other characteristics of the problem. The user can specify target tolerance, maximum
            number of iterations, or even to impose a specific solver. Please, refer to "help helmholtz_solver" for  more details about
            the interface.
         </p>
         <p>IMPORTANT: the use of direct solvers is relatively crippled (by the fact that it does not store the incomplete factors, but
            re-compute them for every single right hand side). This function should see large improvements in the forthcoming releases.
         </p>
         <p><b>Remarks for Developers:</b></p>
         <li>This package allows free surface; this is achieved by setting the PML length   in the top of the domain to zero. See the examples
            for more details.
         </li>
         <li>The legacy routines generates a (n_x*n_y*n_z, 27); this code inverts this to   the more efficient (27, n_x*n_y*n_z).</li>
         <li>The legacy version uses slowness squared. This code allows the user to   choose between meters per second or slowness squared
            (this is emphasized in   the  comments inside the code itself).
         </li>
         <li>The legacy code permutes the z direction to the first dimension. This code   keeps z direction as the third direction.</li>
         <h2>Tests<a name="4"></a></h2>
         <p><b><a href="test_validate.html">test_validate.m</a></b></p>
         <p>This test certifies that the discrete operator computes a satisfactory numerical solution with acceptable dispersion error.
            This test suit also compares the old discretization code with the new one. The Matlab file can be found in the scripts directory.
         </p>
         <p><b><a href="test_helmholt_derivative.html">test_helmholt_derivative.m</a></b></p>
         <p>This test guarantees that the tensor (stored in a band-storage format) computed by helmholt_3d_derivative is in fact the derivative
            of the matrix generated by helmholt_3d.
         </p>
         <p><b><a href="test_gradient.html">test_gradient.m</a></b></p>
         <p>To guarantee that the gradient computed by MisfitFD is in fact the numerical gradient of the misfit function, we written this
            script showing that as we decrease the magnitude of the model perturbation &#948;m, the gradient behaves as a "second order correction".

%% Functions 
% 
% Follows a detailed description of all the functions provided in this toolbox.
% Use 
% 
% |help function_name|
%
% for more details on the input and output of each function. Unless otherwise 
% specified, all function in this package are in its stable release, meaning 
% that its efficiency in computational time, accuracy and memory use has been 
% confirmed through several numerical experiments. Those marked as (beta) and 
% (alpha) should function properly, but have not been extensively tested yet and
% are thus subject to improvements in the future.
%  
% * *WaveEquationFD (alpha)*
% 
% The main function of this package. Given a velocity model and an acquisition
% geometry with its respective dataset, this returns the predicted data, the 
% value of the misfit function for that dataset and the gradient. Each output
% parameter is optional and can be disabled.
% 
% This function handles the whole discretization process; it shrinks/stretches

% * *ForwardFD (beta)*
% 
% A wrapper to WaveEquationFD which returns only the computed data.

% Example: <demo_ForwardFD.html examples/demo_ForwardFD.m>.
% 
% * *MisfitFD (alpha)*
% 
% A wrapper to WaveEquationFD which returns only the most vanilla misfit value
% (no regularization are used in this version) as well as the value of the

% 
% Given a structure model (containing the velocity model and grid spacing) and

% discrete operator as wel as a pointer for the linear solver. The solver is
% chosen based on the size of the problem, discretization used, amongst other
% characteristics of the problem. The user can specify target tolerance, 
% maximum number of iterations, or even to impose a specific solver. Please,
% refer to "help helmholtz_solver" for  more details about the interface.
% 
% IMPORTANT: the use of direct solvers is relatively crippled (by the fact 
% that it does not store the incomplete factors, but re-compute them for every 
% single right hand side). This function should see large improvements in the 
% forthcoming releases. 
%
% *Remarks for Developers:*
%
% # This package allows free surface; this is achieved by setting the PML length 
%   in the top of the domain to zero. See the examples for more details.
% # The legacy routines generates a (n_x*n_y*n_z, 27); this code inverts this to 
%   the more efficient (27, n_x*n_y*n_z).
% # The legacy version uses slowness squared. This code allows the user to 
%   choose between meters per second or slowness squared (this is emphasized in 
%   the  comments inside the code itself).
% # The legacy code permutes the z direction to the first dimension. This code 
%   keeps z direction as the third direction.

%% Tests
%
% *<test_validate.html test_validate.m>*
% 
% This test certifies that the discrete operator computes a satisfactory 
% numerical solution with acceptable dispersion error. This test suit also 
% compares the old discretization code with the new one. The Matlab file can be 
% found in the scripts directory.
%
% *<test_helmholt_derivative.html test_helmholt_derivative.m>*
% 
% This test guarantees that the tensor (stored in a band-storage format) 
% computed by helmholt_3d_derivative is in fact the derivative of the matrix
% generated by helmholt_3d.
%
% *<test_gradient.html test_gradient.m>*
% 
% To guarantee that the gradient computed by MisfitFD is in fact the numerical
% gradient of the misfit function, we written this script showing that as we 
% decrease the magnitude of the model perturbation δm, the gradient behaves as
% a "second order correction".
