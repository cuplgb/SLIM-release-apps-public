%% Full-Waveform Inversion for time-lapse seismic data
%
% This application is available only in the software release for members of SINBAD consortium.
% 
% This package is an application for full-waveform inversion of time-lapse seismic data sets using a modified Gauss-Newton inversion framework. Ideas from distributed compressive sensing and stochastic optimization are exploited to create improved time-lapse models and speed-up the inversion, respectively.

%% Downloading & Dependencies
%
% The code can be found in the <https://www.slim.eos.ubc.ca/consortiumsoftware SLIM sofware release> under
% |/applications/WaveformInversion/TimeLapseFWI|.
%
% The code has been tested with _Matlab R2013a_.
%
% This code uses the following packages, also found in the |tools| part of the <https://www.slim.eos.ubc.ca/consortiumsoftware SLIM software release>.
%
% * _utilities/SPOT_ - object oriented framework for matrix-free linear algebra.
% * _utilities/SegyMAT_ - Matlab/Octave toolbox for reading and writing SEG-Y formatted files.
% * _functions/misc_ - miscellaneous functions.
% * _solvers/SPGL1-SLIM_ - SLIM version of SPGL1 solver.
% * _transforms/CurveLab-2.1.2-SLIM_ - curvelet transform functions.


%% Running & Parallelism
%
% All the examples and results are produced by the scripts found in this software release under |applications/WaveformInversion/TimeLapseFWI/|. Start matlab from that directory or run |startup| in that directory to add the appropriate paths.
%
% To run the scripts follow the instructions in the README file enclosed with the code. The scripts can be run in serial mode.
