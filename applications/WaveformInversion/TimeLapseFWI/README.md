# Full-Waveform inversion for time-lapse seismic data

##  DESCRIPTION
 This package is an application for full-waveform inversion of time-lapse seismic data sets using a modified Gauss-Newton inversion framework. Ideas from distributed compressive sensing and stochastic optimization are exploited to create improved time-lapse models and speed-up the inversion, respectively.
