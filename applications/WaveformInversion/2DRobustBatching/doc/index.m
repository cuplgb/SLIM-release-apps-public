%% Fast Robust Waveform inversion
%
% This software release includes a demonstration of the parallel waveform
% inversion framework in Matlab that has been developed at SLIM. In particular, it
% includes implementations of waveform inversion using robust penalties and
% source estimation [1,2] in conjunction with an optimization strategy that
% works with only a few sources at each iteration [3-6]. Updated to conform to the new
% waveform inversion software framework [8].

%% Downloading & Dependencies
% The code can be found in the <https://www.slim.eos.ubc.ca/consortiumsoftware SLIM sofware release> under
% |/applications/WaveformInversion/2DRobustBatching|.
%
% The code has been tested with _Matlab R2015b_ and requires the Parallel
% Computing Toolbox.
%
% This code uses the following packages, also found in the |tools| part
% of the <https://www.slim.eos.ubc.ca/consortiumsoftware SLIM software release>.
%
% * _utilities/SPOT_ - object oriented framework for matrix-free linear algebra.
% * _utilities/pSPOT_ - parallel extension of SPOT.
% * _algorithms/2DFreqModeling_ - 2D constant-density acoustic modeling
% * _algorithms/CommonFreqModeling - baseline acoustic modeling components
% * _solvers/QuasiNewton - quasi newton optimization algorithms
% * _operators/misc_ - Misc. operators such as interpolation, smoothing and splines
% * _functions/misc_ - Misc. functions.

%% Running & Parallelism
% All the examples and results are produced by the scripts found in
% this software release under |applications/WaveformInversion/2DRobustBatching/|. 
% Start matlab from that directory or run |startup| in that directory to add the appropriate paths.
%
% To run the scripts follow the instrictions in the README file enclosed
% with the code.
% The scripts can be run in serial mode but parallel mode is advised.
