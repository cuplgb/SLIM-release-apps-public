# Time-domain Gauss-Newton full-waveform inversion for Chevron 2014 benchmark dataset
##  DESCRIPTION
This package contains matlab scripts that generates some inversion result for 
Chevron 2014 SEG workshop benchmark dataset. This is an application of SLIM
2D/3D time-stepping forward modeling kernel[1] which can be found in the tools 
folder of this software release. 
##  ON-LINE DOCUMENTATION
An overview of the results can be found in the ./doc directory and online: <br />
