# Total Variation Regularized Wavefield Reconstruction Inversion

##  DESCRIPTION

This MATLAB code implements a scaled gradient projection method to minimize the wavefield reconstruction inversion (WRI) objective subject to total variation and spatially varying bound constraints.  It extends an earlier implementation of the penalty method for full wave form inversion by Tristan van Leeuwen and complements the 2DWRI implementation at <a href = "https://github.com/SINBADconsortium/SLIM-release-apps/tree/master/applications/WaveformInversion/2DWRI">https://github.com/SINBADconsortium/SLIM-release-apps/tree/master/applications/WaveformInversion/2DWRI</a>.
