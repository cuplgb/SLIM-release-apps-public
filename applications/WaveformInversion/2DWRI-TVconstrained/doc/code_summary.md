## Structure of Code and Summary of Algorithm

The main script is `main.m` and can be run by typing `main` at the MATLAB prompt.  It calls 
	
    [model,pm,Ps,Pr,q,d,ssW] = setup_problem(example);

to define a struct of model parameters, `model`, a struct of algorithm parameters, `pm`, sampling operators `Ps` and `Pr` that project onto source and receiver locations respectively, Fourier coefficients of the source wavelet `q` at the sampled frequencies and a cell structure of data, `d`, such that `d{v}` is a frequency slice of data at the frequency indexed by `v`.  It also defines a matrix of weights `ssW` that can be used to blend sources and data to simulate simultaneous shots.

A detailed description of the total variation regularized Wavefield Reconstruction Inversion method can be found in the technical report at <a href="https://www.slim.eos.ubc.ca/content/scaled-gradient-projection-method-total-variation-regularized-full-waveform-inversion">https://www.slim.eos.ubc.ca/content/scaled-gradient-projection-method-total-variation-regularized-full-waveform-inversion</a> and the SINBAD presentation at <a href="https://www.slim.eos.ubc.ca/content/scaled-gradient-projection-method-total-variation-regularized-full-waveform-inversion-0">https://www.slim.eos.ubc.ca/content/scaled-gradient-projection-method-total-variation-regularized-full-waveform-inversion-0</a>.  Briefly, it is minimizing a constrained quadratic penalty objective for acoustic full waveform inversion that has the form
```math #QP
\min_m F(m) \qquad \text{s.t.} \qquad m_i \in [b_i , B_i] \text{ and } \|m\|_{TV} \leq \tau \ .
```
where
```math #F
F(m) = \sum_{sv}F_{sv}(m)
```
and
```math #Fsv
F_{sv}(m) = \frac{1}{2}\|P \bar{u}_{sv}(m) - d_{sv}\|^2 + \frac{\lambda^2}{2}\|A_v(m)\bar{u}_{sv}(m) - q_{sv}\|^2 \ .
```
This nonconvex objective is a sum of squares of data misfits and PDE misfits in the frequency domain, summed over source indices ``s`` and frequency indices ``v``.  

A candidate initial model `minit` is defined in `setup_problem.m`, but if it doesn't satisfy the bound and TV constraints, it is projected onto the nearest model that does by calling the function `proj_TVbounds.m`.

    minit = proj_TVbounds(minit,.99*pm.tau,model.h,pm.dpw,model.mmin,model.mmax);

The resulting initial model is stored in a 3D matrix `mb` that will eventially contain the models (slowness squared) that are estimated after each small batch of frequency data moving from low to high frequencies in overlapping batches.

    mb(:,:,1) = minit; 

For each frequency batch `b`, only a subset of frequency indices `Vb` are used so that the objective we work with is defined by 
```math #FVb
F(m) = \sum_{s,v \in V_b}F_{sv}(m)
```
The result from the previous batch `mb(:,:,b)` is used as a warm start when solving the problem on the next frequency batch for `mb(:,:,b+1)`.  This procedure is carried out in `main.m` with the loop

    for b = 1:model.batches
        [mTV,energy,oits,cinit] = pTV(model,pm,b,mb(:,:,b),Ps,Pr,q,d,ssW,cinit);
        mb(:,:,b+1) = mTV;
	end

The function `pTV.m` solves ([#FVb]) by a sequence of outer iterations of the form
```math #pTVb
\dm & = \arg \min_{\dm} \dm^T \nabla F(m^n) + \frac{1}{2}\dm^T (H^n + c_n\I) \dm  \\
& \text{s.t. } m^n_i + \dm_i \in [b_i , B_i] \text{ and } \|m^n + \dm\|_{TV} \leq \tau \\
m^{n+1} & = m^n + \dm \ .
```
At the current model estimate ``m^n``, it uses the gradient ``\nabla F(m^n)`` and a diagonal Gauss Newton approximation to the Hessian ``H_n`` to construct a quadratic approximation to the objective, which can then be minimized subject to the bound and TV constraints to get a model update ``\dm``.

Inside `pTV.m` is a function `computeGradient()`, which computes the objective, the gradient and the Gauss Newton Hessian via

    [obj,g,H] = computeGradient(m,model,pm,Q,ssW,Ps,Pr,freq_ind,freq,q,d);

The convex subproblems for ``\dm`` are solved by an iterative primal dual method defined in the function `convex_sub()`, which is called by `pTV.m` during every outer iteration via 

    dm = reshape(convex_sub(model,pm,m,g,Hc),n(1),n(2));

At the end of `main.m`, the sequence of model estimates stored in `mb` can be used to make a movie of the algorithm's progress by

    make_movie 
    movie(99,velocity_movie,1,4);


## How to Modify Code to Run Different Examples

Two included examples can be run by typing `main` at the  MATLAB prompt.  In `main.m` set `example = 'blob'` to run a simple example based on a synthetic velocity model that has a high velocity blob against a smooth background velocity that increases linearly with depth.  This model is defined in `setup_problem.m` and does not require any additional data to be downloaded.  Set `example = 'BPC'` to use a downsampled portion of the BP 2004 Velocity Benchmark data set as the true velocity model.

Additional examples can be defined in `setup_problem.m`, which is currently organized as a switch statement

    switch example    
        case {'blob'}
			%sets up parameters and data for blob example
	    case {'BPC'} 
			%sets up parameters and data for BP example
	end

More examples can be included as additional cases.  The following parameter, data and functions are defined in `setup_problem(example)`

* `model.example = example`
* `model.h` -- mesh width in meters
* `model.n` -- model dimensions, depth by width
* `model.N` -- total number of model parameters (defined by `prod(n)`)
* `model.zt = 0:h:h*(n(1)-1)` -- ``z`` coordinates
* `model.xt = 0:h:h*(n(2)-1)` -- ``x`` coordinates
* `model.vtrue` -- define to be true velocity model
* `model.vinit` -- define to be initial velocity model
* `model.vmin` -- minimum velocity (same dimension as model)
* `model.vmax` -- maximum velocity (same dimension as model)
* `model.mtrue = 1./model.vtrue.^2`
* `model.minit = 1./model.vinit.^2`
* `model.mmin = 1./model.vmax.^2`
* `model.mmax = 1./model.vmin.^2`
* `model.freq` -- list of sampled frequencies (Hz)
* `model.nf` -- number of frequencies used
* `model.Vb` -- each row defines a frequency batch by specifying the indices into `model.freq` to be used in that batch
* `model.batches = size(model.Vb,1)`
* `model.f0` -- peak frequency of source wavelet, assumed here to be a Ricker wavelet
* `model.t0` -- phase shift of source wavelet in seconds
* `model.zsrc` -- ``z`` coordinates of source locations
* `model.xsrc` -- ``x`` coordinates of source locations
* `model.ns` -- number of sources
* `model.zrec` -- ``z`` coordinates of receiver locations
* `model.xrec` -- ``x`` coordinates of receiver locations
* `model.nr` -- number of receivers
* `q` -- Fourier coefficients of the source wavelet at the sampled frequencies
* `model.vweights` -- optional frequency dependent weights to scale each ``F_{sv}(m)`` component of the objective
* `model.nsim` -- number of simultaneous shots
* `model.redraw` -- `1` to randomly redraw weights, `0` for no redraws
* `model.rngshots = rng('shuffle')` -- store seed for random number generator
* `ssW` --  matrix of weights that can be used to blend sources and data to simulate `model.nsim` simultaneous shots.  If `model.redraw = 1`, these are redrawn from a Gaussian distribution every time the model is updated.  If `model.redraw = 0`, the weights in `ssW` don't change.  The case of sequential shots corresponds to setting `model.nsim = ns`, `model.redraw = 0` and `ssW = speye(ns,model.nsim)`.
* `Ps` and `Pr` -- sampling operators that project onto source and receiver locations.  Their definitions currently assume that these locations correspond to points in the discretization.
* `model.Xint` and `model.Xbnd` -- masks used in defining the absorbing boundary condition, which here is a simple Robin boundary condition
* `model.L` -- Discrete Laplacian defined by `L = getDiscreteLap(n,h)`, which uses a simple ``5`` point stencil
* `model.rngnoise = rng('shuffle')` -- store seed for random number generator
* `model.dsig` -- if nonzero, then frequency dependent Gaussian random noise is added to the data with standard deviation `model.dsig/sqrt(model.ns*model.nr)` times the norm of each frequency slice of data `d{v}`
* `model.M = @(ff,mm) (2*pi*ff)^2*spdiags(model.Xint(:).*mm(:),0,N,N) - ...`
   `1i*(2*pi*ff)*spdiags(model.Xbnd(:).*sqrt(mm(:)),0,N,N)` -- this function of frequency and model is used in the definition of the Helmholtz operator `L + M`
* `d` -- data defined by `generateData(model,q,Ps,Pr)`
* `model.D` and `model.E` are defined by `[D,E] = getDiscreteGrad(n(1),n(2),h,pm.dpw)` and used to define the TV constraint
* `pm.dpw` -- optional depth weights to make the strength of the TV penalty depth dependent.  Should be a vector of length `model.n(1)` with values between ``0`` and ``1``.
* `pm.TV = @(t) sum(sqrt(E'*((D*t(:)).^2)))` -- function for evaluating the total variation of a `model.n(1)` by `model.n(2)` image.
* `pm.mu` -- numerical parameter that doesn't change objective but can affect rate of convergence.  OK to set to ``1``.
* `pm.lambda` -- penalty parameter for PDE misfit
* `pm.tau` -- parameter for total variation constraint.  The total variation of the true model is `pm.TV(model.mtrue)`
* `pm.cmin` and `cmax` -- bounds on an adaptive parameter for damping the Hessian 
* `pm.c1` -- factor to decrease c if objective is decreasing enough
* `pm.c2` -- factor to increase c if objective doesn't decrease enough
* `pm.sigma` -- what fraction of ideal objective decrease is acceptable

* `pm.otol` -- tolerance for outer iteration stopping condition
* `pm.maxoits` -- maximum number of allowed outer iterations
* `pm.minoits = min(2,pm.maxoits)` -- minimum number of outer iterations
