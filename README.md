# Public snapshots of MATLAB-software repository for SLIM software release to SINBAD consort
## 1 DESCRIPTION
 This is the repository for SLIM's software release for SINBAD
 consortium members. The release contains applications and tools
 (including 3-rd party prerequisites) necessary to demonstrate and use
 algorithms developed by SLIM's researchers. SLIM's software release is
 organized in two repositories:
### 1.1 Repository SLIM-release-apps-public - this repository
 Repository at [SLIM-release-apps-public]
 (https://github.com/SINBADconsortium/SLIM-release-apps-public) contains core
 of SLIM's software, i.e. all applications, algorithms, tools, and
 utilities. The software in this repository requires minimal
 installation, but some of the applications depend on installation of
 SLIM-release-comp-public listed below.
 
 Note that each user must have a private copy of SLIM-release-apps-public in
 order to to run any applications, since an application is configured
 to look for data and create directories inside of application's
 directory. See INSTALLATION file for possible installation strategies.
### 1.2 Repository SLIM-release-comp-public
 Repository at [SLIM-release-comp-public]
 (https://github.com/SINBADconsortium/SLIM-release-comp-public) containing
 extra 3rd-part software for multi-user installation - not needed for
 some applications from repository SLIM-release-apps-public. The installation
 of software from this repository may be shared by multiple users and
 may require lengthy installation.  See INSTALLATION file for possible
 installation strategies.
## 2 COPYRIGHT

## 4 INSTALLATION
 Follow the instructions in the INSTALLATION file in this repository to
 install core of SLIM's software and create necessary scripts to
 configure your environment. If installation of 3rd-part software from
 SLIM-release-comp-public is required, follow the instructions in INSTALLATION
 file of SLIM-release-comp-public before you install software in this
 repository. You will need to have MATLAB installed and added to your
 PATH environment before you can proceed. If you encounter any problems
 during the installation, please, let us know. See SUPPORT section at
 the end for contact information.
## 5 SHELL ENVIRONMENT
 You must configure your shell environment before you can run any
 applications. The environment.* scripts, created during installation,
 will set SLIM_COMP (and if needed and available), SLIM_APPS, and
 SLIM_APPS_RUNS environments and add necessary executable and library
 paths to your shell. You will not be able to run applications if
 SLIM_COMPS /SLIM_APPS/SLIM_APPS_RUNS  variables are not set correctly
 or MATLAB executables are missing from your shell's PATH environment.
### 5.1 Importing shell environment
 In order to import shell environment you will have to source one of
 the scripts in the home of SLIM-release-apps-public. 
#### 5.1.1 From the home of SLIM-release-apps-public
 In the terminal window and once per terminal session, change directory
 to the home of SLIM-release-apps-public and do either of the following:
##### 5.1.1.1 in bash-like shell execute
 	. environment.sh
##### 5.1.1.2 in csh-like shell execute
 	source environment.csh
#### 5.1.2 From another location
 If you want to source either of those scripts from the location other
 then the home of SLIM-release-apps-public (like from your shell's startup
 scripts). Then, in the terminal window (and only once per terminal
 session) do either of the following from any location:
##### 5.1.2.1 in bash-like shell execute
 	. path_to-SLIM-release-apps-public/environment.sh
##### 5.1.2.2 in csh-like shell execute
 	source path_to-SLIM-release-apps-public/environment.csh
##### 5.1.2.3 optional for interactive jobs and obligatory for batch submission
 Add the appropriate one of the above to your default-shell's startup
 script to make the permanent change to the environment. You will not
 need then to source environment.sh/csh manually.
### 5.2 Testing your environment
 Once configured, you can check if the SLIM_COMP , SLIM_APPS, and
 SLIM_APPS_RUNS environments are set correctly and verify if MATLAB
 executables are in the PATH using:
#### 5.2.1 in bash-like shell execute
 	test_env4slim.sh
#### 5.2.2 in csh-like shell execute
 	test_env4slim.csh
## 6 MATLAB startup for batch jobs
 Users who intend to run their jobs in non-interactive batch mode must
 add those extra steps:
### 6.1 Add startup_slim.m script to those ~/matlab directory
  First. create ~/matlab directory if it does not exists.
 
 Execute the following command in terminal:
 
 	cp $SLIM_APPS/skel/startup_SLIM.m ~/matlab
### 6.2 Call startup_SLIM script at the end of ~/matlab/startup.m
  First, create ~/matlab/startup.m if it does not exist.
 
 Add the following line at the end of ~/matlab/startup.m:
 
 	startup_SLIM
## 7 RUNNING APPLICATIONS
 Please, see the specific instructions that are included in the README
 file in each application's directories. The application directories
 are organized by topics and are located inside of applications/
 directory in the root of unpacked SLIM's software release. See SLIM
 software's components sections in this README for the current list of
 applications.
 
 Note, that you might need to download the data before running an
 application. The relevant instructions can be found in application's
 README file.
### 7.1 Typical execution sequence
 Running any application (after the input file(s) are downloaded)
 involves typically the following steps:
 
 - open Matlab  
 - start parallel pool with appropriate number of workers, if needed  
 - change directory to the main directory of desired application  
 - run `startup` if `startup.m` file exists in this directory  
 - change directory to the directory of scrips/examples if such exists 
 - run `startup` if `startup.m` file exists in this directory  
 - run desired script  
 
 The above steps will ensure that the toolboxes necessary for the
 application are loaded and the input data files are found.
 
### 7.2 `RunApplication` helper function
 A provided MATLAB function `RunApplication` helps running our
 applications. It executes the steps above (except for starting the
 parallel pool) and ensures that: 1) appropriate toolboxes are added
 before application is being used, and 2) that the application is
 executed in proper location. For more information how to use this
 function type in MATLAB:
 
 	help RunApplication
 
#### 7.2.1 Using `RunApplication` in interactive mode
 You will need to create parallel pool with appropriate number of
 workers before executing `RunApplication`.
#### 7.2.2 Using `RunApplication` in batch (non-interactive) mode
 Function `RunApplication` also allows to easily submit our
 applications to run in the non-interactive batch mode using the
 following syntax:
 
 	batch(@RunApplication, 0, {x1,..., xn}, *other_batch_options...*)
 
 where  `{x1,..., xn}` are the same arguments as used for
 `RunApplication` in the interactive mode, but enclosed in the cell
 array. For more information about batch command, and its options, type
 in MATLAB:
 
 	help batch

## 9 SLIM software's components
 The SLIM's software is divided into to main components: applications
 and tools. Tools are mostly for general use or are typically problem
 independent; e.g., algorithms and solvers are considered as tools.
 Applications illustrate how those different tools can be used to solve
 specific problems.
